This sample demonstrates performance benefits of streamed asynchronous data I/O and computations. Two versions of CUBLAS matrix-matrix multiplication routines are measured for performance, including time spent on moving input & output arrays between host and device. Serial mode routine is just a regular *gemm, while streamed version cuts big matrices into smaller submatrices and streams their transfer and computation asynchronously.

Usage example:

[dmikushin@tesla-cmc gemm_streamed]$ ./gemm_streamed 4 1024 1025 1 N N 1.0 0.0 16
n	time		gflops		test	enorm		rnorm
